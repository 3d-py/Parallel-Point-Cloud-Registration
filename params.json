  "body": "### SUMMARY\r\nIn this project, we plan to parallelize the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm for point\r\ncloud processing system using the NVIDIA CUDA library.\r\n\r\n### ALGORITHM\r\nPoint Cloud Registration (PCR) plays an important role in computer vision since a well-aligned point\r\ncloud model is the bedrock for many subsequent applications such as Simultaneous Localization and\r\nMapping (SLAM) in the robotics and autonomous cars domain or Automatic Building Information\r\nModeling in the architectural industry. Nowadays, point clouds are usually gathered by multiple\r\ncameras or laser scanners with their own coordinate systems. The objective of Point Cloud Registration\r\n(PCR) is to search a transformation that could align a reading point cloud with a reference point cloud in\r\na consistent coordinate system. The process of finding the transformation and the closest point\r\ninvolves lots of matrix operations that are usually independent between each other. Given the intermediate\r\nlevel of dependency and the huge size of the problem, exploiting the parallelism can be a good\r\nalternative to speed up the algorithm.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
